## Patterns
Place for patterns documentation until sub folder structure in place

* Mount patterns and dummy data in `src/index.js`
* Live preview patterns `http://localhost:9999/lib/`

### Mega menu
* Use `react-data-fetching` to handle API promise and error, unit test covered
* API endpoint url as `props`
